## 🕵️‍ Confusion:

When I first started working with React, I always had this confusion that even though my functional component has no reference to React(since I could not see any mention of React keyword in the component), then why do I need to have import React from “react"; at the top of my file. 😕

This is how we create a simple functional component in react:-

```jsx
import React from 'react'
const App = () => <div>Hello World!!!</div>
export default App
```

## 🔬 Problem:

This code looks like a very simple function with some html inside it but it fails to work if we use it without

```jsx
import React from 'react'
```

The problem here is if it’s just some function with html inside it, then it should work without the import statement 🤔

## 😍 Finding:

After reading more about it and after seeing the code which get’s generated after transpilation, I could finally understand why it’s needed 😯

The reason is because of JSX 😃 The code which looked like plain html to me is actually JSX 🙇

So after babel transpilation, this is how the same code looks

```js
var App = function App() {
  return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello World!!!')
}
```

The important thing to focus here is **React.createElement** and this is the reason why we need to import React at the start of any functional component. 🎉 🙌

Hope this helps anyone who is starting with React and is confused about why `import React from “react"` is needed.

Since I recently traveled to India and I have been asked by a couple of people around the rules and regulations of flying to India from Germany, I am trying to share all the information that I had gathered before my flight.

**Note**: I have also made a youtube video explaining how I planned my travel via Air France. Most of those procedures apply to other airline carriers as well.
